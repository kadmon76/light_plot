# Light Plot Designer - Project Status

## Current Architecture

We have implemented a clean, modular architecture for the Light Plot Designer that follows DRY principles:

### Core Structure
- **State Management**: Centralized state for the application using the module pattern
- **Event System**: Loosely coupled components using EventEmitters
- **Configuration**: Constants separated in a dedicated config module

### Element Architecture
- **BaseElement**: Foundation class that all elements inherit from
- **Behaviors**: Composable behaviors that can be added to any element
- **Element Types**: FixtureElement and PipeElement implementations

### Key Components
1. **Core**: 
   - config.js: Configuration constants
   - state.js: Application state management
   - events.js: Global event handling

2. **Elements**:
   - base-element.js: Base class for all plot elements
   - fixture-element.js: Lighting fixture implementation
   - pipe-element.js: Pipes and trusses implementation

3. **Behaviors**:
   - behavior.js: Base class for all behaviors
   - behavior-manager.js: Applies behaviors to elements
   - draggable.js: Dragging functionality
   - selectable.js: Selection functionality
   - rotatable.js: Rotation functionality
   - lockable.js: Locking functionality

4. **UI**:
   - canvas.js: SVG canvas setup and management
   - toolbar.js: Tool selection and buttons
   - property-panel.js: Element property editing
   - libraries.js: Fixture and pipe libraries

5. **Utils**:
   - svg-utils.js: SVG helper functions
   - event-emitter.js: Event handling utility
   - modal-utils.js: Reusable modal dialog system

### Design Principles
- **DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)**: Common functionality in base classes and behaviors
- **Single Responsibility**: Each module has one clear purpose
- **Loose Coupling**: Components communicate via events
- **Composable Behaviors**: Elements gain functionality through behavior composition
- **Measure twice cut once**: Have a clear idea, ask questions and follow up questions and gather as much information on any given changes or new element that should be added before moving forward with coding.
- **Work using small steps**: Each chat should not be more than 5-6 prompts and always think and gather new data and summarize it as best you can so the next chat could follow up without any problems

## Recent Updates

### Added Modal System
- Implemented a reusable modal utility (modal-utils.js) based on Bootstrap
- Created functions for creating, showing, hiding, and updating modals
- Support for different modal sizes, custom content, and event handlers
- Special helper for confirmation modals
- Maintains references to created modals for easy management

### Added Lighting Console Paradigm Support
- Implemented two addressing systems for fixtures:
  - **Unified Approach**: Single numbering system for all fixtures
  - **Families Approach (Compulite style)**: Separate numbering for channels and spots
- Added plot-level setting for the addressing system
- Modified property panel to adapt to the selected addressing system
- Enhanced fixture creation to respect the chosen paradigm
- Added locking mechanism to prevent addressing system changes after fixtures are added

### Added "Add Fixtures" Modal
- Created a dedicated fixtures-modal.js module to handle modal creation and management
- Integrated with existing UI by using a single "Add Fixtures" button
- Implemented dynamic form that changes based on selected placement pattern (line, grid, circle, manual)
- Created flexible structure to accommodate different fixture types
- Populated fixture types from the backend dynamically when the modal opens

## Next Steps

1. Implement form validation and error handling in the "Add Fixtures" modal
   - Add client-side validation for required fields
   - Provide visual feedback for validation errors
   - Handle edge cases (zero quantity, invalid patterns, etc.)

2. Implement fixture creation functionality
   - Create fixtures based on the selected pattern
   - Calculate placement positions for line, grid, and circle patterns
   - Handle manual placement mode
   - Apply selected properties (color, starting channel, purpose)

3. Complete the libraries panel functionality
   - Fixture properties (fixture id, naming, DMX address, gel number/color, purpose, notes, lock)
   - Grouping and filtering (by color, purpose, type, universe)
   - Validation to prevent conflicts (duplicate IDs)
