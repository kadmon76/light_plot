# Project Status: Light Plot Designer

## Current Architecture Progress
- Refactored FixtureElement to properly extend BaseElement
- Updated ElementFactory to leverage the improved BaseElement
- Added event-based property system integration
- Modified SelectableBehavior to dispatch events for property panel integration

## Latest Changes
- Added element property change tracking and event dispatching
- Updated ElementFactory to use a consistent approach for all element types
- Modified SelectableBehavior to emit selection events for integration
- Prepared new setupPropertyPanel implementation for event-based system

## Element Creation Flow
1. User interacts with UI or code requests element creation
2. Request goes to ElementFactory (central factory for all elements)
3. ElementFactory creates the appropriate element type
4. Element is registered and behaviors are applied
5. Property changes trigger events for UI updates

## Selection Flow
1. User clicks on element
2. SelectableBehavior handles the click
3. Element's select() method is called
4. SelectableBehavior dispatches element:selected event
5. Property panel listens for this event and displays properties

## Next Immediate Goals
1. Verify property panel integration is working correctly
2. Debug any event dispatching issues
3. Apply same refactoring pattern to PipeElement
4. Enhance property panel to handle both element types consistently

## Files Modified
- designer/static/designer/js/modules/types/element-factory.js
- designer/static/designer/js/modules/elements/behaviors/selectable.js
- designer/static/designer/js/modules/properties.js

## Debugging Recommendations
1. Add console.log statements to verify events are being dispatched
2. Check property panel element IDs match expected values
3. Verify element property access through prop() method works
4. Test direct manipulation of properties to see panel updates
