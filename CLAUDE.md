# Project Status: Light Plot Designer

## Current Architecture Focus
- Implementing a DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) approach
- Transitioning to a behavior-based, composable element architecture

## Recent Achievements
- Refactored `ElementFactory` to centralize element creation
- Updated `fixtures.js` to work with `ElementFactory`
- Identified need to integrate `BaseElement` across element types

## Next Immediate Goal
Integrate `BaseElement.js` into the Fixture Element Creation Process

### Specific Tasks
1. Update `FixtureElement` to extend `BaseElement`
2. Modify element creation methods to leverage `BaseElement` capabilities
3. Ensure consistent property management and serialization

## Files to Prepare for Next Chat
- `designer/static/designer/js/modules/types/fixture-element.js`
- `designer/static/designer/js/modules/elements/base-element.js`
- `designer/static/designer/js/modules/elements/element-factory.js`
- `designer/models/fixture.py` (Django model)

## Scope for Next Chat
- Refactor `FixtureElement` to inherit from `BaseElement`
- Implement base property management
- Ensure compatibility with existing element creation methods

## Guiding Principles
- Maintain DRY approach
- Keep element creation flexible
- Minimize code redundancy
- Leverage existing base classes

## Questions to Address
- How to best extend `BaseElement` for fixture-specific needs?
- What additional methods or properties might be unique to fixtures?
