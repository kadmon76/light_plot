# Light Plot Designer - Project Status

## Current Architecture

We have implemented a clean, modular architecture for the Light Plot Designer that follows DRY principles:

### Core Structure
- **State Management**: Centralized state for the application using the module pattern
- **Event System**: Loosely coupled components using EventEmitters
- **Configuration**: Constants separated in a dedicated config module

### Element Architecture
- **BaseElement**: Foundation class that all elements inherit from
- **Behaviors**: Composable behaviors that can be added to any element
- **Element Types**: FixtureElement and PipeElement implementations

### Key Components
1. **Core**: 
   - config.js: Configuration constants
   - state.js: Application state management
   - events.js: Global event handling

2. **Elements**:
   - base-element.js: Base class for all plot elements
   - fixture-element.js: Lighting fixture implementation
   - pipe-element.js: Pipes and trusses implementation

3. **Behaviors**:
   - behavior.js: Base class for all behaviors
   - behavior-manager.js: Applies behaviors to elements
   - draggable.js: Dragging functionality
   - selectable.js: Selection functionality
   - rotatable.js: Rotation functionality
   - lockable.js: Locking functionality

4. **UI**:
   - canvas.js: SVG canvas setup and management
   - toolbar.js: Tool selection and buttons
   - property-panel.js: Element property editing
   - libraries.js: Fixture and pipe libraries
   - fixtures-modal.js: Modal for adding multiple fixtures at once

5. **Utils**:
   - svg-utils.js: SVG helper functions
   - event-emitter.js: Event handling utility
   - modal-utils.js: Reusable modal dialog system

### Design Principles
- **DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)**: Common functionality in base classes and behaviors
- **Single Responsibility**: Each module has one clear purpose
- **Loose Coupling**: Components communicate via events
- **Composable Behaviors**: Elements gain functionality through behavior composition
- **Measure twice cut once**: Have a clear idea, ask questions and follow up questions and gather as much information on any given changes or new element that should be added before moving forward with coding.
- **Work using small steps**: Each chat should not be more than 5-6 prompts and always think and gather new data and summarize it as best you can so the next chat could follow up without any problems

## Recent Updates

### Fixed Fixture Visibility Issue (May 2025)
- Fixed critical issue where fixtures weren't appearing on the canvas despite being created
- Replaced SVG.js method calls with direct DOM manipulation for reliable element addition
- Added proper SVG namespace handling for element creation
- Implemented coordinate system transformation for fixture positioning
- Applied appropriate scaling and visibility attributes
- Fixtures from the library now appear properly on the canvas

### Improved Modal System
- Utilized the existing modal utility (modal-utils.js) based on Bootstrap
- Fixed ID consistency issues to ensure modals are properly referenced
- Added constants to prevent typos in modal IDs

### Enhanced Form Validation
- Implemented Bootstrap's built-in form validation system instead of custom validation
- Added validation for all required fields with appropriate error messages
- Set up form validation feedback using Bootstrap classes
- Added mechanism for custom validation (like checking for duplicate IDs)
- Improved user experience with focused fields on error and form reset on modal close

### Fixture Creation UI
- Completed the "Add Fixtures" modal with support for different placement patterns:
  - Line pattern: horizontal or vertical arrangement with spacing control
  - Grid pattern: rows and columns with horizontal and vertical spacing
  - Circle pattern: radius and start angle controls
  - Manual placement: one-by-one fixture placement
- Dynamic form updates based on the selected pattern
- Integration with fixture types from the existing sidebar

## SVG Normalization for Fixtures (2024-06)

- All fixture SVGs (from backend/admin or future user uploads) are now automatically normalized and centered in the frontend.
- The normalization logic is implemented in the `FixtureElement` class:
  - Any SVG, regardless of its original `viewBox` or size, is scaled and centered to fit a standard 40x40 box at (0,0).
  - This ensures consistent sizing and placement for all fixtures on the canvas.
- This approach is DRY: the normalization logic lives in one place and applies to all fixture creation flows.
- The backend continues to provide the SVG markup, but the frontend is responsible for rendering consistency.
- This prepares the app for future user-uploaded fixtures, ensuring robust and predictable rendering.

## Next Steps

1. Code Cleanup and Refactoring
   - Remove temporary debugging statements and test elements
   - Consolidate fixture creation approaches (SVG.js vs. direct DOM manipulation)
   - Extract common fixture creation logic into reusable functions
   - Simplify event handlers and ensure proper cleanup
   - Improve error handling for SVG parsing and DOM operations
   - Standardize coordinate transformations
   - Document edge cases and workarounds

2. Fixture Enhancements
   - Improve fixture selection and property editing
   - Add behavior for locking fixtures in place
   - Implement fixture duplication and copy/paste
   - Add fixture focusing and beam visualization

3. Modular Behavior Refactoring
   - Implement DRY principle with shared behaviors
   - Create a more consistent behavior-based architecture
   - Improve behavior composition and event handling

4. User Interface Improvements
   - Add more visual feedback for element interaction
   - Implement undo/redo functionality
   - Add snap-to-grid and alignment tools
   - Improve fixture property panel
