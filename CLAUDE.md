# Project Status: Light Plot Designer

## Current Architecture Focus
- Implementing a DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) approach
- Building a behavior-based, composable element architecture

## Latest Achievements
- Refactored `FixtureElement` to properly extend `BaseElement`
- Implemented proper property management with event handling
- Improved serialization by extending base methods
- Added dedicated methods for property-specific visual updates

## Current State
- FixtureElement now properly leverages BaseElement functionality
- Property changes trigger appropriate visual updates through events
- Maintained backward compatibility with existing code
- Better separation between base functionality and fixture-specific features

## Next Immediate Goals
1. Update ElementFactory to work with refactored FixtureElement
2. Ensure property panel integration with new property management
3. Apply similar pattern to PipeElement class
4. Test changes to ensure functionality is maintained

## Files to Prepare for Next Chat
- `designer/static/designer/js/modules/types/element-factory.js`
- `designer/static/designer/js/modules/properties.js`
- `designer/static/designer/js/modules/types/pipe-element.js`
- `designer/static/designer/js/modules/fixtures.js`

## Scope for Next Chat
- Refactor ElementFactory to leverage improved BaseElement integration
- Update property panel integration to work with event-based property system
- Begin applying pattern to PipeElement class

## Guiding Principles
- Maintain DRY approach
- Keep element creation flexible
- Minimize code redundancy
- Leverage event system for property changes

## Questions to Address
- How to best update property panel to work with the new event system?
- What common functionality from FixtureElement can be extracted for PipeElement?
