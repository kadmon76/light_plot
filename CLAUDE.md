# Light Plot Designer - Project Status

## Current Architecture

We have implemented a clean, modular architecture for the Light Plot Designer that follows DRY principles:

### Core Structure
- **State Management**: Centralized state for the application using the module pattern
- **Event System**: Loosely coupled components using EventEmitters
- **Configuration**: Constants separated in a dedicated config module

### Element Architecture
- **BaseElement**: Foundation class that all elements inherit from
- **Behaviors**: Composable behaviors that can be added to any element
- **Element Types**: FixtureElement and PipeElement implementations

### Key Components
1. **Core**: 
   - config.js: Configuration constants
   - state.js: Application state management
   - events.js: Global event handling

2. **Elements**:
   - base-element.js: Base class for all plot elements
   - fixture-element.js: Lighting fixture implementation
   - pipe-element.js: Pipes and trusses implementation

3. **Behaviors**:
   - behavior.js: Base class for all behaviors
   - behavior-manager.js: Applies behaviors to elements
   - draggable.js: Dragging functionality
   - selectable.js: Selection functionality
   - rotatable.js: Rotation functionality
   - lockable.js: Locking functionality

4. **UI**:
   - canvas.js: SVG canvas setup and management
   - toolbar.js: Tool selection and buttons
   - property-panel.js: Element property editing
   - libraries.js: Fixture and pipe libraries

5. **Utils**:
   - svg-utils.js: SVG helper functions
   - event-emitter.js: Event handling utility

### Design Principles
- **DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)**: Common functionality in base classes and behaviors
- **Single Responsibility**: Each module has one clear purpose
- **Loose Coupling**: Components communicate via events
- **Composable Behaviors**: Elements gain functionality through behavior composition
- **Mesure twice cut once** have a clear idea, ask question and follow up cquestions and gather as much information on any giving changes or new element that should be added before moving foward with coding.
- **work using small steps. each chat should not be more then 5-6 prompts and always think and gather new data and summerize it as best you can so the next chat could follow up without any problems

## Recent Updates

### Added Lighting Console Paradigm Support
- Implemented two addressing systems for fixtures:
  - **Unified Approach**: Single numbering system for all fixtures
  - **Families Approach (Compulite style)**: Separate numbering for channels and spots
- Added plot-level setting for the addressing system
- Modified property panel to adapt to the selected addressing system
- Enhanced fixture creation to respect the chosen paradigm
- Added locking mechanism to prevent addressing system changes after fixtures are added

### Current Task: Reusable Modal System
We are now implementing a reusable modal system for adding fixtures. Key objectives:
- Create a reusable modal utility that leverages Bootstrap
- see where we can use Bootstrap on other elements in the program. only if it serve thepurpose of DRY principelse  
- Implement an "Add Fixtures" dialog for batch fixture creation
- Support different placement patterns (line, grid, manual)
- Handle DMX addressing and fixture properties
## Next Steps

1. Complete the libraries panel functionality
   decide on the proporties for each element that the user creates (not to confused with elements that are pre build and the user chooses from the list): 
   a.fixture id
   b.naming
   c.univers add + dmx add
   d.gel number and color+ type of  gel munofactore
   e.color (this could help gather fixtures with the same color, then when user wants to see or print only those color he would have the option)
   f.purpose (we can use list of type of purpose like high cross, cyc, front, spacial and user defind one) this should group together fixtures with the same purpose. again the user could have the ability to see or print only those fixtures
   g. notes. for user reference on each fixture
   h. lock in place switch
2. we need to think on the logic of creating and adding fixrues: how the user choose the type of the fixture and  when he gives the proporties. my best idea is to have a pop up window apear where the user add the relevent options like : fixture id, address color and all the other proporties. he should have the ability to create more then one fixture at a time. 
   example :
      fixture number: 1 to 6 
      name :front 1 to front 6
      univers : 1
      dmx address: 101 to 106
      type: par 64
      gel : lee #201
      color : <rgb param>
      purpose : front
      notes : front from the house front pipe , 1.5 meter between each fixture
      lock : true
3. after creating the fixtures the user can select individual fixtures and change them.
4. there should be a system that checks the backend for inconsistencises like if the user changes the id to one that alread is occupide
5. we need to find a way to let the user select groups by color, purpose, type, univers... 
6. work on the backend and add all the new elements and proporties we add
7. Implement save/load functionality with Django backend
8. Add element deletion and other editing operations
9. Implement keyboard shortcuts and additional tools
10. Improve visual styling and user experience
11. Add basic validation and error handling
