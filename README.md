# Light Plot Designer

A web application for creating theatrical lighting plots using vector graphics.

## Project Overview

Light Plot Designer is a Django-based application that allows lighting designers to create, edit, and share theatrical lighting plots. The application uses SVG.js for vector graphics manipulation and provides a user-friendly interface for designing lighting layouts.

## Current Features

- Vector-based drawing with zoom and pan capabilities
- Standard A4 layout with stage representation
- Fixture library with drag-and-drop placement
- Pipe/truss system for hanging fixtures
- Property editing for fixtures (channel, color, purpose, etc.)
- Save/load functionality for lighting plots

## Development Progress

### Completed
- âœ… Basic application structure with Django
- âœ… Editor interface with SVG canvas
- âœ… Fixture placement and manipulation
- âœ… Pipe/truss placement and manipulation
- âœ… Basic saving and loading of plots
- âœ… Modular JavaScript architecture
- âœ… Model-Controller-Presenter (MCP) architecture
- âœ… Pipe/truss enhancements
  - Ability to stretch/resize pipes through properties panel
  - Locking pipes in place to prevent movement
  - Visual indicators for selected and locked pipes
- âœ… Fixed pipe dragging behavior

### In Progress
- ðŸ”„ Modular behavior system refactoring
  - Implementing DRY principle with shared behaviors
  - Creating behavior-based architecture for elements
- ðŸ”„ Fixture enhancements
  - Locking fixtures in place
  - Improving fixture selection and property editing
- ðŸ”„ Stage measurement display
  - Toggle-able measurements
  - Improved stage representation

### Planned Features
- ðŸ“‹ Fixture focus and beam visualization
- ðŸ“‹ DMX addressing and patch integration
- ðŸ“‹ Plot export (PDF, DWG)
- ðŸ“‹ Collaboration features
- ðŸ“‹ Detailed inventory reports
- ðŸ“‹ Direct manipulation handles for pipe stretching

## Code Structure

- `/designer` - Django app for the lighting plot designer
  - `/models` - Database models for plots, fixtures, stages
  - `/controllers` - Business logic layer for MCP architecture
  - `/presenters` - UI logic layer for MCP architecture
  - `/static/designer/js/modules` - Modular JavaScript components
    - `/elements` - Core element functionality (base element, behaviors)
    - `/behaviors` - Composable behaviors (dragging, rotating, etc.)
    - `/types` - Element type implementations (pipes, fixtures, etc.)
    - `/ui` - UI components (properties panel, selection, etc.)
  - `/templates` - HTML templates

## Architecture Principles

The project follows these key principles:
- **DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)** - Identify common functionality across different elements and create reusable, shared components rather than duplicating code
- **Single Responsibility** - Each module has a clear, focused purpose
- **Composable Behaviors** - Elements are built from reusable behaviors
- **Command Pattern** - For undoable operations
- **Event-based communication** - For loose coupling between components

## Running the Project

1. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
2. Apply migrations: `python manage.py migrate`
3. Run the server: `python manage.py runserver`
4. Access the application at http://localhost:8000
